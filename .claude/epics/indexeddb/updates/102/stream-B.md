# Stream B: Dexie数据库架构实现

## Scope

实现NoteumDB数据库类，定义数据库schema和表结构，设置数据库版本管理。

## Files

- packages/web/src/services/storage/database.ts ✅
- packages/web/src/services/storage/schema.ts ✅
- packages/web/src/services/storage/migrations.ts ✅
- packages/web/src/services/storage/database.test.ts ✅
- packages/web/src/test-setup.ts ✅

## Progress

### Completed ✅

1. **Database Schema Implementation**
   - Created `schema.ts` with complete TypeScript interfaces for all 5 tables
   - Defined TokenRecord, PreferenceRecord, SettingRecord, CacheRecord, MetaRecord
   - Added schema validation utilities and migration helpers
   - Implemented TABLE_NAMES enum for type safety

2. **NoteumDB Database Class Implementation**
   - Created `database.ts` with full Dexie.js integration
   - Implemented complete database initialization and lifecycle management
   - Added automatic cleanup functionality for expired data
   - Implemented database statistics and usage monitoring
   - Added proper error handling and event management

3. **Database Migration System**
   - Created `migrations.ts` with comprehensive migration framework
   - Implemented backup and restore functionality  
   - Added migration planning and execution system
   - Supports rollback mechanisms for failed migrations

4. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Added `fake-indexeddb` for testing environment
   - Created comprehensive test suite with 14 test cases
   - All tests passing with 100% functionality verification
   - Configured vitest with proper IndexedDB mocking

5. **Dependencies**
   - Installed dexie@^4.2.0 for IndexedDB operations
   - Added fake-indexeddb@^6.2.2 for testing
   - Updated vite.config.ts with test configuration

### Implementation Details

#### Database Tables Schema
- **tokens**: Authentication token storage with expiration
- **userPreferences**: User-specific preference settings  
- **appSettings**: Application-wide configuration
- **apiCache**: API response caching with TTL
- **metadata**: System metadata and versioning

#### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ Type-safe database operations
- ✅ Automatic timestamp management (createdAt, updatedAt)
- ✅ Data expiration and cleanup
- ✅ Database statistics and monitoring
- ✅ Migration system with backup/restore
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Debug mode support

#### Test Coverage
- Database initialization and schema verification
- CRUD operations for all table types
- Automatic timestamp handling
- Data cleanup and expiration
- Database statistics calculation
- Factory function testing
