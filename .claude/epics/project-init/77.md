# Task: Set up monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces

## Description
Create the foundational monorepo structure using pnpm workspaces to manage shared code between web and Tauri clients. This includes setting up the package.json files, pnpm-workspace.yaml, and directory structure for all project components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Root package.json configured for pnpm
- [ ] `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file created and configured
- [ ] Directory structure created for shared, web, tauri, and server packages
- [ ] Shared package with common utilities and types
- [ ] Basic build and development scripts configured for pnpm
- [ ] README documentation for pnpm-based monorepo structure

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Use pnpm workspaces to create a monorepo structure.
- Key considerations: 
  - Proper `pnpm-workspace.yaml` configuration.
  - Consistent naming conventions across packages.
  - Shared dependencies management with pnpm.
- Code locations/files affected:
  - Root `package.json`
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  - `packages/shared/package.json`
  - `packages/web/package.json`
  - `packages/tauri/package.json`
  - `packages/server/package.json`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js and pnpm installed
- [ ] Basic understanding of pnpm workspaces

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
