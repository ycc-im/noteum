# Issue #94: Tauri Configuration Error

## Description

Tauri build is failing due to configuration error in `tauri.conf.json`. The `readTextFile` property under `allowlist.fs` is not recognized.

## Error Details

```
Error `tauri.conf.json` error on `tauri > allowlist > fs`: Additional properties are not allowed ('readTextFile' was unexpected)
Error: Command "npm ["run","tauri","build","--","--target","x86_64-apple-darwin"]" failed with exit code 1
```

## Context

This error occurs during the Tauri build step in GitHub Actions. The CI pipeline passes all other steps (dependencies, linting, testing) but fails on the Tauri build.

## Technical Requirements

1. Research Tauri v1 configuration schema for allowlist properties
2. Create/update `tauri.conf.json` with correct property names
3. Set up proper Tauri project structure in packages/tauri
4. Configure GitHub Actions workflow for desktop builds
5. Test Tauri build locally and in CI

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tauri configuration file uses correct schema
- [ ] Desktop app builds successfully in CI
- [ ] Local development environment works
- [ ] Integration with existing monorepo structure

## Related Work

- Issue #83: Tauri Desktop App Build Pipeline - Main CI/CD setup completed
- The basic pipeline infrastructure is working, this is a configuration issue

## Priority

Medium - Does not block other development work, but needed for desktop app functionality.
