# Stream 2: Shared UI Components Library

## Scope
Create a basic shared UI components library within the `packages/shared/components` directory. This will include simple, reusable components like buttons and inputs that can be used by both the web and Tauri clients.

## Files
- packages/shared/components/

## Progress
- ✅ Created components directory structure
- ✅ Implemented Button component with multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost)
  - Framework-agnostic design using factory functions
  - Support for different sizes (small, medium, large)
  - Customizable via props and CSS classes
  - Includes getButtonClasses, getButtonAttributes, and createButtonConfig utilities
- ✅ Implemented Input component with full form support
  - Multiple input types (text, email, password, etc.)
  - Validation states and error handling
  - Label, helper text, and error message support
  - Framework-agnostic design using factory functions
  - Includes getInputClasses, getLabelClasses, and createInputConfig utilities
- ✅ Created component export index file
- ✅ Updated shared package main entry point to export components
- ✅ Committed changes with detailed commit message

## Implementation Details
The shared UI components library has been implemented as framework-agnostic TypeScript modules that can be consumed by both React (web) and any future Tauri desktop client. The design uses factory functions and utility methods to generate CSS classes and component attributes, allowing easy integration with any frontend framework.

### Components Implemented:
1. **Button Component** (`packages/shared/src/components/Button.ts`)
   - Variants: primary, secondary, outline, ghost
   - Sizes: small, medium, large
   - Full accessibility support with proper focus states
   - Utility functions for CSS class generation

2. **Input Component** (`packages/shared/src/components/Input.ts`)
   - Multiple input types supported
   - Built-in validation and error state handling
   - Label and helper text support
   - Responsive design with proper sizing

### Architecture Benefits:
- Framework-agnostic: Can be used with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS
- Type-safe: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive interfaces
- Customizable: Easy to extend and customize via props
- Consistent: Unified design system across all clients
- Maintainable: Single source of truth for UI components

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
All requirements for the Shared UI Components Library stream have been fulfilled.
