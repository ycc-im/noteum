# Issue #94 Stream A Progress Update

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Stream**: A - Tauri v2 Configuration & Setup

## Work Completed

### ðŸš€ Tauri v2 Project Structure Created
- Set up complete src-tauri directory structure
- Created all necessary configuration files with v2 schema
- Successfully replaced deprecated allowlist system

### ðŸ“‹ Key Configuration Files Created
- `tauri.conf.json` - Uses Tauri v2 schema (https://schema.tauri.app/config/2)
- `Cargo.toml` - Configured with Tauri 2.x dependencies
- `main.rs` & `lib.rs` - Rust application entry points
- `capabilities/default.json` - Modern permissions system
- Basic HTML frontend for testing
- Proper .gitignore for Rust projects

### âš¡ Modern Permissions System
- Replaced deprecated `allowlist.fs.readTextFile` with `fs:default` 
- Configured core permissions: `core:default`, `fs:default`, `shell:allow-open`
- Set up window-state and dialog plugins
- Ready for file system operations with proper scoping

### ðŸ”§ Monorepo Integration
- Updated package.json with Tauri CLI dependency
- Added proper build and dev scripts
- Integrated with existing pnpm workspace

### âœ… Verification Complete
- All Rust code compiles successfully (`cargo check` passes)
- Configuration validated against v2 schema
- Ready for desktop app development

## Next Steps
The Tauri v2 setup is complete and resolves the original configuration error. The project now uses the modern permissions system and is ready for:
1. Desktop app development
2. CI/CD integration 
3. Production builds

**Original Issue Resolved**: The `allowlist.fs.readTextFile` error is completely fixed by migrating to Tauri v2's permissions-based configuration.
