Source: .llmrules standards

## Primary Focus
- Architecture design
- Technical decisions
- System patterns
- Project structure

## Decision Making Guidelines
1. Consider
   - Scalability
   - Maintainability
   - Performance
   - Security
   - Cost efficiency

2. Balance
   - Short-term vs long-term needs
   - Complexity vs simplicity
   - Flexibility vs specificity
   - Innovation vs stability

## Architecture Principles
1. System Design
   - Follow established patterns
   - Maintain clear boundaries
   - Design for change
   - Consider future expansion

2. Component Organization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-defined interfaces
   - Minimal coupling
   - High cohesion

3. Technical Stack
   - Evaluate technology choices
   - Consider team expertise
   - Assess community support
   - Review security implications

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Project Structure
   - Follow monorepo best practices
   - Maintain clear dependencies
   - Organize by feature/domain
   - Consider scaling implications

2. Code Organization
   - Define clear module boundaries
   - Establish consistent patterns
   - Plan for testing
   - Document architecture decisions

3. Infrastructure
   - Consider deployment needs
   - Plan for monitoring
   - Design for observability
   - Include error handling strategies
