### Requirement: Branch Management Workflow

All development work SHALL follow strict branch management practices to ensure code stability and traceability.

#### Scenario: Working from main branch

- **THEN** they SHALL create a new feature branch before making any changes
- **AND** the new branch SHALL be based on the latest main branch
- **AND** the branch SHALL follow the naming convention `[###-task-description]`

#### Scenario: Branch creation and switching

- **WHEN** creating a new feature branch
- **THEN** the branch SHALL be created from an up-to-date main branch
- **AND** all changes SHALL be committed to the feature branch
- **AND** no direct commits SHALL be made to the main branch

#### Scenario: Branch completion

- **WHEN** feature work is complete
- **THEN** a pull request SHALL be created from the feature branch to main
- **AND** the pull request SHALL pass all automated checks
- **AND** code review SHALL be completed before merging

### Requirement: Test-Driven Development Practice

All code changes SHALL follow test-driven development principles unless explicitly exempted.

#### Scenario: TDD implementation process

- **WHEN** implementing new functionality
- **THEN** failing tests SHALL be written first (Red phase)
- **AND** minimal code SHALL be written to make tests pass (Green phase)
- **AND** code SHALL be refactored while maintaining test coverage (Refactor phase)
- **AND** all tests SHALL pass before proceeding to next feature

#### Scenario: Exempt file types

- **WHEN** working with files that don't require tests
- **THEN** the following file types SHALL be exempt from TDD requirements:
  - Configuration files (.env, .config.js, tsconfig.json)
  - Constant definitions and enums
  - Build scripts and deployment scripts
  - Documentation files (.md, .txt)
  - Type definition files (.d.ts) that only contain types
  - Static asset files

#### Scenario: Test coverage requirements

- **WHEN** writing testable code
- **THEN** 100% test coverage SHALL be maintained for new code
- **AND** all critical paths SHALL have corresponding tests
- **AND** test files SHALL use .spec.ts or .test.ts suffix

### Requirement: Development Process Validation

The development workflow SHALL include validation steps to ensure compliance with established practices.

#### Scenario: Pre-commit validation

- **WHEN** committing code changes
- **THEN** all tests SHALL pass
- **AND** code SHALL pass linting checks
- **AND** TypeScript SHALL compile without errors
- **AND** branch SHALL not be the main branch

#### Scenario: Code review requirements

- **WHEN** reviewing pull requests
- **THEN** adherence to TDD practices SHALL be verified
- **AND** branch management compliance SHALL be checked
- **AND** test coverage requirements SHALL be confirmed
- **AND** code quality standards SHALL be validated

#### Scenario: Workflow exception handling

- **WHEN** exceptions to standard workflow are necessary
- **THEN** exceptions SHALL be documented in commit messages
- **AND** team lead approval SHALL be obtained
- **AND** alternative quality assurance measures SHALL be implemented
