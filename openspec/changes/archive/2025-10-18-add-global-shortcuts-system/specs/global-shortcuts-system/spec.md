#### Scenario: Mac platform shortcuts

- **WHEN** a Mac user presses Command+N
- **THEN** the system SHALL recognize it as the new note shortcut
- **AND** the system SHALL detect the Meta key (Command)
- **AND** the system SHALL recognize it as the standard new note shortcut

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: User Preferences Enhancement

The original user preferences system supported basic configurations like theme and language. The enhanced system SHALL support shortcut configuration storage using JSON format to store complex shortcut mapping data.

#### Scenario: Enhanced preferences loading
