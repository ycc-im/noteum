# Dexie.js Integration Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dexie.js Dependency Integration
The client application SHALL integrate Dexie.js as the IndexedDB wrapper library.

#### Scenario: Package installation
- **WHEN** setting up the development environment
- **THEN** Dexie.js SHALL be added as a runtime dependency to the client package.json
- **AND** the version SHALL be compatible with the project's TypeScript configuration

#### Scenario: Database initialization
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** a single Dexie instance SHALL be created with proper schema definition
- **AND** database connection SHALL be established with error handling
- **AND** connection failures SHALL trigger appropriate retry mechanisms

### Requirement: IndexedDB Authentication Storage
The application SHALL store authentication data in IndexedDB instead of localStorage.

#### Scenario: Login data storage
- **WHEN** a user successfully authenticates
- **THEN** access tokens, refresh tokens, and user data SHALL be stored in IndexedDB
- **AND** token expiration dates SHALL be tracked for automatic cleanup
- **AND** data SHALL be indexed for efficient retrieval

#### Scenario: Authentication state retrieval
- **WHEN** the application loads or authentication state is requested
- **THEN** the system SHALL retrieve auth data from IndexedDB
- **AND** validate token expiration status
- **AND** automatically refresh expired tokens when possible

#### Scenario: Logout data cleanup
- **WHEN** a user logs out
- **THEN** all authentication data SHALL be removed from IndexedDB
- **AND** any cached sensitive data SHALL be cleared
- **AND** the database connection SHALL remain available for future use

### Requirement: localStorage to IndexedDB Migration
The system SHALL provide seamless migration from localStorage to IndexedDB.

#### Scenario: Existing data detection
- **WHEN** the application starts with existing localStorage auth data
- **THEN** the system SHALL detect and validate existing authentication tokens
- **AND** initiate migration to IndexedDB without user interruption
- **AND** preserve user session continuity

#### Scenario: Data migration process
- **WHEN** migrating authentication data
- **THEN** token validity SHALL be verified before migration
- **AND** data SHALL be transferred with proper error handling
- **AND** localStorage SHALL be cleared after successful migration
- **AND** migration failures SHALL not corrupt existing data

#### Scenario: Migration rollback
- **WHEN** IndexedDB operations fail during migration
- **THEN** the system SHALL fallback to localStorage temporarily
- **AND** log appropriate error messages for debugging
- **AND** retry migration on next application startup

### Requirement: IndexedDB Performance Optimization
The database implementation SHALL follow performance best practices for large-scale data.

#### Scenario: Query optimization
- **WHEN** executing database queries
- **THEN** appropriate indices SHALL be used for filter conditions
- **AND** queries SHALL include reasonable limits to prevent excessive memory usage
- **AND** complex queries SHALL be broken into smaller, efficient operations

#### Scenario: Batch operations
- **WHEN** handling multiple database operations
- **THEN** bulk operations SHALL be used for better performance
- **AND** transactions SHALL be kept short to prevent blocking
- **AND** operations SHALL be properly scoped to minimize locking

#### Scenario: Storage management
- **WHEN** database size grows significantly
- **THEN** automatic cleanup of expired data SHALL be performed
- **AND** storage usage SHALL be monitored and reported
- **AND** size limits SHALL be enforced with user notification when needed

### Requirement: Error Handling and Recovery
The IndexedDB implementation SHALL include comprehensive error handling.

#### Scenario: Connection failures
- **WHEN** IndexedDB connection cannot be established
- **THEN** exponential backoff retry logic SHALL be implemented
- **AND** graceful degradation to alternative storage SHALL be considered
- **AND** users SHALL receive appropriate error notifications

#### Scenario: Data corruption handling
- **WHEN** corrupted data is detected during read operations
- **THEN** the affected data SHALL be cleaned up
- **AND** data restoration from backup SHALL be attempted if available
- **AND** the application SHALL remain functional with default states

#### Scenario: Browser compatibility
- **WHEN** running in browsers without IndexedDB support
- **THEN** the system SHALL detect lack of support
- **AND** gracefully fallback to alternative storage mechanisms
- **AND** provide appropriate user guidance if needed

### Requirement: Authentication State Persistence with IndexedDB
The system SHALL provide authentication state persistence using IndexedDB for secure and reliable storage.

#### Scenario: Session restoration with IndexedDB
- **WHEN** a user returns to the application
- **THEN** the system SHALL restore authentication state from IndexedDB
- **AND** validate token expiration using database indexes
- **AND** automatically refresh tokens without user intervention

#### Scenario: Secure IndexedDB storage
- **WHEN** tokens are stored in IndexedDB
- **THEN** they SHALL be protected by browser's same-origin policy
- **AND** accessible only to the application origin
- **AND** automatically cleared on secure logout events
