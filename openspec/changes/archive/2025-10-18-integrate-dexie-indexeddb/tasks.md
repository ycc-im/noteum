- [ ] Implement performance tests for large datasets
- [ ] Test browser compatibility across supported browsers

### 4.2 Migration Testing

- [ ] Test migration from localStorage with various data scenarios
- [ ] Validate data integrity during and after migration
- [ ] Test rollback scenarios and error recovery
- [ ] Verify session continuity during migration process
- [ ] Load test migration with large authentication datasets

### 4.3 Security & Performance Validation

- [ ] Verify token security in IndexedDB storage
- [ ] Test data cleanup on logout and expiration
- [ ] Validate same-origin policy enforcement
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against localStorage
- [ ] Memory usage analysis under various conditions

## Phase 5: Deployment & Cleanup (Week 5)

### 5.1 Final Implementation

- [ ] Remove localStorage dependencies from codebase
- [ ] Clean up migration code and feature flags
- [ ] Update build process to include new dependencies
- [ ] Final code review and optimization
- [ ] Update deployment documentation

### 5.2 Monitoring & Maintenance

- [ ] Set up production monitoring for database operations
- [ ] Create alerting for database errors and performance issues
- [ ] Implement automated database cleanup jobs
- [ ] Add logging for audit trails and debugging
- [ ] Create maintenance procedures for database health

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

- Must coordinate with frontend team for Zustand store changes
- Requires testing across all supported browsers
- Need to verify Tauri desktop app compatibility
- Coordinate with backend team on any token format changes

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All authentication data stored in IndexedDB
- [ ] Existing localStorage data migrated without loss
- [ ] Login/logout functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable (>20% faster auth operations)
- [ ] No regressions in authentication flow
- [ ] Browser compatibility maintained
- [ ] Security posture improved
- [ ] Code coverage >90% for new database code

## Risk Mitigation

- **Data Loss Risk**: Implement backup and rollback mechanisms
- **Performance Risk**: Monitor and optimize database operations
- **Compatibility Risk**: Test across all supported environments
- **Security Risk**: Follow security best practices for token storage
- **Migration Risk**: Gradual rollout with feature flags
